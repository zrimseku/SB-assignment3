# SB-assignment3 
## Ear recognition using convolutional neural networks

To use the code in this repository first make a conda envoronment using `environment.yml` file.
Then prepare the data from *AWE* dataset with script `data_prepare.py`.
CNN training is implemented in script `train.py`, the best models are in folder `best models`.
You can test them using script `test.py`.

In notebook `plots.ipynb` you can see the selection of best models and empirical choosing of training parameters.

If you are interested in more information about training and testing, read the report `ZrimsekUrsa3.pdf`
